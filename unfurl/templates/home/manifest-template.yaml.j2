# This Ensemble manifest was generated during creation of your ~/unfurl_home and models
# the local environment Unfurl runs inside of, e.g. the client machine or container,

# It is a regular Ensemble so you can configure your local environment
# by adding your own templates and deploying this like any other Ensemble.
